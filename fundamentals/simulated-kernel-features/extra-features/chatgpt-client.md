In addition to all the extra features provided to you, you can also use an unofficial ChatGPT client made by us. To learn more about what is ChatGPT, click here:

Once you have your account's OpenAI API key for ChatGPT, you can use this client by executing the `chatgpt` command with your API key. After that, you can write any prompt, such as telling it to generate a poem, a story, a case study, a letter, and so on, as long as such prompts follow the terms and conditions.

You can use the slash commands to use the commands that are defined by the ChatGPT shell. This shell is powered by the [Semantic Kernel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/overview/) library made by Microsoft.

{% hint style="info" %}
You must read the [terms and conditions](https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use/) of ChatGPT and OpenAI before you can use this service. Any prompt that violate these terms will be greeted with a friendly reminder about the terms of service.
